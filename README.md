## Installation

### PyPI

To install the latest release from PyPI, simply enter the following at the command prompt:

```

### GitHub

To install the latest version of the code directly from GitHub:

1. Open Terminal.

2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

```
cd <path/to/directory/>
```

3. Copy, paste, and execute the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/yuempark/pystrat.git
